So I have graduated with an IT degree, time to get a job and live life.

Given the range of subjects I have covered:
* Web Development
* Database Development
* CCNA subjects
* Unix Systems Administration
* Windows Server Administration
* Network Security
* Virtualisation

It's a bit surprising that after a year and a half of searching I'm still on step 1.



Countless job applications, less than a handful of interviews and still no success.

So what is to be done
